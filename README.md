# Sorting-Visualizer
A Sorting Visualizer is an interactive project that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.) work by visually animating the step-by-step process of arranging an array. It helps in understanding algorithm efficiency and behavior through engaging graphical representation.
